Idea: User has a POV experience sitting on a couch browsing through youtube clips.

How i would do this is by fetching data from youtubes API. What I would need to do is send a request
from youtubes API through Unity. I already have a sense on how to get data from the weather API we worked on
in class. What is going to be challenging is being able to code an animation that shows the POV of the characters arm with a remote flipping through videos and triggering video playback when user presses a button.
