The work art of mechnaical reproduction has a great relation to
digital games and how its played. Games are reproducded from main
root ideas from other games. Its the art of the way a digital game is
released that differs from the others. A great example is with the PC
game called "PUBG". PUBG's main concept was a battle Royale game where
players kill each other on a massive map until theres one man standing.
EPIC GAMES which is a gaming company reproduced this concept of
battle royale and implemented it into their own game called "Fornite".
Reproduction in digital games is very familiar today.
